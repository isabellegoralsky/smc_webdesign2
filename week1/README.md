# Week 1 Work : HTML/CSS Demo
Directions: Please create a small website with 1 page - for an artist making anything you enjoy.

The site should have:

+ a separate CSS file for all the styles
+ use an external font (e.g. one of the fonts available on Google Fonts)
+ a 3x3 grid gallery of images on the Home page showing the examples of work
+ At least one header and at least two paragraphs of text
+ A form with name, email, subject and message fields for people to contact the artist
+ A portrait of an artist side by side with a short bio (this counts as one of the required paragraphs)
+ valid HTML/CSS (can use validator to check)
+ all images downloaded and sourced from local files


Pay attention to layout, typography and color choices, make sure things are neat and purposeful - your visual presentation is a part of the grade. Make sure all the images are downloaded and sourced from the local files.
